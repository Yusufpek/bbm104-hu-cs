### Extra
- I did not implement extra part of the assignment.
- I randomised the ducks' colors and ducks' starting positions.
- I added unlimited ammo mode
    * When you are in the background selection screen you can activate or deactivate unlimited ammo mode. 
    * If it is activated, your remaining ammo is showing with "âˆž" and does not increase.
- There is a wierd problem which i want to mention here.
    * When the game completed all levels are finished the "Press Enter...Press ESC..." text is not showing sometimes. 
    * "Game Completed" text is showing always but the others not showing, i did not understand and solve this problem.
